                In today’s world, technology often takes priority over fitness. This can lead to a generation that may struggle with physical tasks and experience more health issues, both physical and mental, due to lack of exercise. This project is designed to support P.E. professors in tracking students’ progress in fitness activities. It aims to promote a stronger culture of fitness at the University of Makati by making physical activities more engaging and motivating for students.
